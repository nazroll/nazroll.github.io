## Cloud architect. Open Source enthusiast. Rollerblader.

Iâ€™m Nazrul ðŸ‘‹ 

The story of my life is currently about leading engineering teams build secure, governance-first cloud platforms, crafting open-source tools, and rolling through life one video at a time. I believe great work blends trustworthiness with a spark of fun. 

Rollerblading taught me that every fall is a chance to learn, and the best tricks come from staying curious, honest, and a little daring.
